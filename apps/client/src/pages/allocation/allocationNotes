Create a new table

sessionAllocations

this needs to store the session types

The TeacherSession model represents the relationship between a Teacher and a Session and includes the number of sessions allocated to the teacher for that particular session type.

In addition to the new model, both the Teacher and Session models have been updated to include a many-to-many relationship via the TeacherSession model.

The teachers field in the Session model now represents the teachers assigned to that particular session type, while the sessionAllocated field in the Teacher model represents the sessions allocated to the teacher.

All the changes made to the Prisma schema should enable you to query the relationships between teachers and sessions, as well as update the number of sessions allocated to a particular teacher for a specific session type.
